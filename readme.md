# Charity Theme for Melody and Movable Type

The Charity theme allows for rapid deployment of a charity-focused site, with some of the common features found on such a site -- though to be honest, it includes features anybody may like! This theme is based on Classic Blog, Minimalist but includes a number of additional features:

* Image galleries for both Pages and Entries
* Include an accent image in the site header
* Support for a navigation menu with links to Pages
* Easily configurable Facebook Like button
* Easily configurable Footer text

As well as the familiar features of Classic Blog Minimalist:

* Many 2- and 3-column page layouts
* 10 theme colors
* Easily manageable sidebars through Widgets and Widget Sets

See the Charity theme in action at [dwcomedy.com](http://dwcomedy.com/), the web site for the annual Dillon Wilson Comedy for the Cure event.
