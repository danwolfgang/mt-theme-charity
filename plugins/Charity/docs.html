<p>The Charity theme is based on the Classic Blog Theme Pack's &ldquo;Classic Blog, Minimalist&rdquo; theme. In addition to the capabilities of that theme, Charity introduces some additional features and flexibility aimed at making it easy to start a charity-centric web site. Some of the features of this theme:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 15px; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Several colors and layout options to choose from.</li>
    <li>Include an image in the header of the site.</li>
    <li>Include a navigation menu based on Page content.</li>
    <li>Include an image gallery with any (or every) Page and Entry.</li>
    <li>Support for Action Streams to collate activity on other web sites.</li>
    <li>Customize the Facebook Like button design.</li>
</ul>

<p>Two and three column layouts are supported. In the <strong>Page Layout</strong> Theme Option, &ldquo;t&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;thin,&rdquo; &ldquo;w&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;wide,&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo; is a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; column though wider than &ldquo;thin.&rdquo; Republish the site after changing layouts.</p>

<p>Manage the sidebars of this blog with <strong>Widgets and Widget Sets</strong>. In the Design menu you can visit Widgets, then select a Widget Set and edit its contents with drag-n-drop simplicity. Use any of the available Widgets to customize this blog, or create new Widgets to add to the sidebar.</p>


<h3>Theme Options</h3>

<p>Visit <strong>Theme Options</strong> (in the Design menu) to set options for this blog.</p>

<p>The Facebook Like Button and PayPal Donations options rely upon those Widgets being a part of the Widget Sets used for the site. (By default, these Widgets are included and are therefore functional.)</p>


<h3>Pages and Entries</h3>

<p>Entries are used for the actual &ldquo;blog&rdquo; component of this site. Pages are used as other unique types of content for the site. A handful of Pages have been created to help you get started.</p>

<p>Both Entries and Pages support image galleries. To see the Image Gallery field, visit the Display Options in the upper-right and enable the Image Gallery field. Select files to upload, then save. After the Page or Entry is saved, the label and description of each image in the gallery may be edited (though it is not necessary to change them).</p>


<h3>Publishing</h3>

<p>Some Templates use the <strong>Publish Queue</strong> to publish less-frequently visited archives in the background, making this blog feel faster. Be sure that <code>run-periodic-tasks</code> has been properly set up with this Melody or Movable Type installation so that the Publish Queue can run.</p>

<p><strong>Server Side Includes (SSI)</strong> are enabled on this theme, a feature which can further improve publishing times. Your server will need to be able to parse <code>.html</code> files as PHP. To disable SSI, visit the Preferences menu and choose Publishing. Be sure to republish after setting or changing the SSI option. Configuring SSI is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
